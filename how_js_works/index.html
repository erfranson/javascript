<h1>How Javascript works</h1>
<h2>What happens in the javascript engine </h2>
<p>
    our code start in the browser > the host the uses a javascript engine to parse our code which reads our code and
    checks if the syntax of our code is correct if there are mistakes it throws an error and stops execution. > If
    everything is correct it creates a data structure called the abstract syntax tree. > that is then converted into
    Machine Code > I then runs the code and does it's work
</p>

<h2>Execution Context/Stack</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Execution Context:</strong> A Box, a container, ore wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of
        our code is evaluated and executed <br/>
    <strong>First:</strong>Runs code that is not inside any function, Anything that is in the global object gets
    attached to the window object
</p>
<p>The Execution context object contains:</p>
<ol>
    <li>variable object</li>
    <li>Scope Chain</li>
    <li>"This" Variable</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>creation phase:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Creation of the Variable Object</li>
            <li>Creation of the scope Chain</li>
            <li>Determine value of the 'this' variable</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Execution phase:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>The code of the function that generated the current execution context is ran line by line</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Variable Object Process</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into the function.</li>
    <li>Code is scanned for function declarations: for each function, a property is created in the Variable Object,
    pointing to the function.</li>
    <li>Code is scanned for variable declarations: for each variable, a property is created in the Variable Object,
    and set to undefined</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions and variables are hoisted in javascript which means they are available before the execution stack starts
    functions are defined before the execution phase stars, while variables are set to undefined and will only be
    defined in the execution phase.
</p>
<p><strong>Scoping chain</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Scoping answers the question "where can we access a certain variable?</li>
    <li><strong>Each new function creates a scope:</strong> The space/environment, in which the variables it defines
        are
        accessible</li>
    <li><strong>Lexical Scoping: a function that is lexically within another function gets access to the
        scope of the outer function.</strong></li>
    <li>Scope chain: Order in which functions are written lexically</li>
</ul>
