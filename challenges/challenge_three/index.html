<h1>Challange Three</h1>

<p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills where $124, $48, and $268.</p>
<p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). Hes likes to tip 20% of the
    bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200 and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
<p>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
    <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
</ol>

<p>(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100 = 0.2)</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK</p>
