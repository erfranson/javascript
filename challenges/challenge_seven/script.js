 Coding challenge

 1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
 a) Question itself
 b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array,
  object, etc.)
 c)  correct answer (I would use a number for this)

 2. Create a couple of question using the constructor

 3. store them all inside and array

 4. select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should
  have a number) (Hint: write a method for the question objects for this task).

 5. use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. the user should input the number of the
  correct answer such as you displayed it on task 4.

 6.Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not (hint: write another
  method for this).

  7. suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. so make sure that all your code
   is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do
    exactly that).
