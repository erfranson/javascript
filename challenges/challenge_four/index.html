<h1>Challenge Four</h1>
<p>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and john compared there BMIs. Let's now implement the same
    functionality with objects and methods.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass and height</li>
    <li>Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from
        the method.</li>
    <li>In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and respective BMI.
        Dont for get they might have the same BMI</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).</p>
